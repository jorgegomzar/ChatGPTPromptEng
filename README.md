# ChatGPTPromptEng

Personal repo for learning purposes. This is a docker dev env with Jupyter Notebook. 

I am following this course https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/

In order to use this repo:

1. Generate a .env file following [.env.template](.env.template) with your `OPENAI_API_KEY`
2. Run `make complete-build` in a terminal at the root of this repo.
3. Once it is up and running: run `make get-api` to get the link to the Jupyter Notebook. (If this doesn't work at the first time, try it a second one)
4. Click on the link and proceed to code on the notebooks using your browser.
